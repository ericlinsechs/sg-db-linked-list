# Sorting singly and doubly circular linked list
## Overview
This repository provides a versatile implementation for sorting both singly and doubly circular linked lists. It encapsulates the sorting functionality to make it easy for you to work with linked lists in your projects.
## Usage
```
./main [OPTION]  // Options: 0 for singly linked list, 1 for doubly linked list
```
Choose the appropriate option based on whether you want to work with a singly linked list (0) or a doubly linked list (1).
